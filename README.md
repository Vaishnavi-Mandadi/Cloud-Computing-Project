# **AWS Data Lake and Data Warehouse Project**

## **Overview**
This repository documents our team's project in the "Fundamentals of Cloud Computing (MIS-612)" course, where we focused on building a data lake and data warehouse, and creating interactive dashboards on AWS for Cloud Solutions Factory ICT (CSF-ICT). Our team, composed of Business Analysts and Developers, was tasked with handling a diverse dataset from a new client, necessitating the construction of a robust and scalable data analytics platform.

## **Project Components**
Data Lake and Warehouse Creation: Leveraged AWS services to build a secure and efficient data storage and processing infrastructure.

Interactive Dashboard Development: Utilized AWS Quicksight for creating dashboards to visualize and analyze the data effectively.

AWS Services Utilized: Athena, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Cognito, Cost Explorer, EMR, Glue, IAM, Kinesis, Lambda, Redshift, S3, Sagemaker, SNS, X-Ray, and others.

Third-party Integrations: Included Apache Kafka, Matillion, Nifi, Power BI, and Snowflake for enhanced functionalities beyond AWS capabilities.

## **Architecture**
The project architecture was designed for optimal cost, performance, and security. The architecture diagram within the repository illustrates the interconnectedness of various AWS and third-party services.

## **Challenges and Lessons Learned**
Service Selection: Identifying the most suitable use case for each AWS service was challenging.

Technical Issues: Encountered specific issues with Athena queries, Redshift commands, and service integrations.

Collaboration Hurdles: Overcame difficulties in code sharing and setup across different accounts.

Learning Curve: Gained insights into the complexities of cloud service connectivity and setup.

## **Repository Contents**
